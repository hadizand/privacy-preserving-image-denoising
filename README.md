# privacy-preserving-image-denoising


We have proposed a lossless privacy preserving image denosing method which protects the users' privacy and maintains the quality of the denoising task, concurrently.

The main code proposed by the authors is in LosslessPrivacyPreservingImgDenoising.m file. Only input the local path of the noisy image to run the code.
The rest of the .m files that we used are publicly available for running the image denoising algorithm based on dictionary learning.
